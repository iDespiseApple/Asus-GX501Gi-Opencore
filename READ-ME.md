HELLO WORLD im new to all this whatever this is and heres is my project:

Opencore Build for

                 specs:
                       Intel Core i7 8750H
                       nVidia 1080 GTX Max-Q

                       /bluetooth
                       bios version: 313
                       
                       
    ive made this Opencore, compiled the ssdts myself except for a few like xosi and usb reset, 
    this build installs catalina then reboots at 2 minutes and starts the installation process again, cant get past this
    this build also gets you to the first screen in big sur/monterey where it shows a image of a mouse and etc. usb error
    working on resolving those issues!
    
    
    any input from the community would be greatly appreciated 
    any one else with the same laptop that has had success with catalina and or higher version, PLEASE share :)
    
    im confident itll work on high sierra with few modifications to config.plist 
    
    also make sure to replace airportltlwm.kext with appropiate version for the macOS version your installing! 
    current airportltlwm.kext version in this build is Monterey Latest stable version available as of 6-8-2022
                       
                       
    I welcome any and all feedback and advice as im very new to all this sharing to the world what ive done or built!
    SEE YA L8TR ;) ALLIGATOR!:D
